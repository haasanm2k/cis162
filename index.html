            I work as a broadcast engineer. My job functions includes Audio and Video compression, encryption, streaming etc.
            I need to learn automation and plan to take Java Script and Python classes at Cerritos College.
            CIS162 is a prerequisite class for Java Script.
            If I become good at programming, I look forward to learn API programming.
            Automation and API programming are very essential at broadcast engineering functions.
